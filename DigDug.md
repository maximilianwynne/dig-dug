# DigDug

My Python version of Dig Dug is a coin-collecting maze adventure. 

Monsters chase and catch up to the player if they are not quick on their feet. Collect all ten coins before one of the monsters closes in on you. 

Each iteration of the game features different tunnel, monster, and player positions.
