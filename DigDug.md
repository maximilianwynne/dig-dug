# DigDug

My Python version of Dig Dug is a coin-collecting maze adventure. 

Monsters chase and catch up to the player if they are not quick on their feet. Collect all ten coins before one of the monsters closes in on you. 

## Features

Each iteration of the game features different tunnel, monster, coin, and player positions.

While the map remains static, each coin, monster, and player is spaced out evenly in order to give you, the player, a chance to both collect coins and evade the monsters.
