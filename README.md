# DigDug

My Python version of Dig Dug is a coin-collecting maze adventure. 

Monsters chase and catch up to the player. Player must collect all ten coins in one stage before a monster closes in on them. 

## Features

Each iteration of the game features different tunnel, monster, coin, and player positions.

While the map layout remains static for the game, each coin, monster, and player is spaced out evenly in order to give you a solid chance to both collect coins and not collide with monsters when beginning the game. 

Some coins spawn in tunnels with monsters already in them.
