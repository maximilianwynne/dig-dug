Dig Dug

My Python version of Dig Dug is a coin-collecting maze adventure. 

Monsters chase and can catch up you if you are not quick on your feet. Collect all ten coins before one of the monsters closes in on you. 

Each iteration of the game features different tunnels, monster, and player starting points.
